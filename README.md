# IPChecker
IPChecker is a simple tool built using Node and JavaScript. This tool will check you're public IP address every minute and if it has changed then it will grab it and send it to Discord webhook. This tool is very useful for home-hosted servers. This is a fully open-sourced project and completly free to use. You do not have to credit me in anyway. Enjoy :D
